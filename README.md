# Hugo - the extension you really want! [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/felicianotech/hugo-browser-extension.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/felicianotech/hugo-browser-extension) [![Software License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felicianotech/hugo-browser-extension/master/LICENSE)

A Chrome extension that enhances your browsing experience for Hugo.
Right now, the basic features allow you to see when a website you're visiting has been built with Hugo as well as search the Hugo Docs from your Omnibar (address) Bar.


## Installing

This extension can be installed via the [Chrome Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hugo-the-extension-you-re/hbaembbfbmpbjgkgcjcfonnimlekbfea/).


## Features

- **Built with Hugo?** - the icon for this extension (the Hugo logo) is full color when browsing a website built with Hugo and greyed out otherwise.

- **Docs Search** (Omnibox/address bar) - search Hugo Docs right from Chrome's Omnibox. Instructions below.


## How-To

### Searching

This extension supports quick searches. Currently, only Hugo Docs can be searched but more search types are on the roadmap.

### Search Hugo Docs

In the Omnibox (address bar) type `hugo` and press tab to activate Search. Then, type `d`, a space, and then one or more search terms to search Hugo Docs.

### Examples

Search for the `humanize` function in Hugo Docs by typing: `hugo <tab> d humanize`


## Feature Roadmap

The best place to see what features are being considered and which are coming up is via the GitHub Issue tab for this repo. That being said, here's a short list of my most desired ones:

- be notified of new Hugo releases
- be able to see what listed Hugo theme a website is using (if any)
- suggest Hugo related blog posts as submissions to the Hugo Newsletter
